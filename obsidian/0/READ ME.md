# Exploration Overview

Purpose: explore missingness in our 30-country subset across multiple dimensions
(economic, ecological, political, demographic) to understand deeper structural patterns.

## Analytical Sequence

1. Measure missingness and identify data-poor countries
2. Test whether missingness aligns with development (HDI, GDP, income)
3. Explore ecological balance: footprint vs biocapacity
4. Study whether ecological stress relates to missingness
5. Examine footprint externalization (production vs consumption)
6. Compare regions in footprint, sustainability, and missingness
7. Analyse environmental inequality (footprint per capita, biocapacity per capita)
8. Evaluate governance and SDGi effects on missingness
9. Investigate Overshoot Day presence and absence
10. Study footprint composition to identify ecological structure
11. Cluster countries into sustainability archetypes
12. Build a composite sustainability index
13. Write summary and country profiles

## Connections
All angles support the central question:
**what explains missingness in environmental data?**

Use links to connect:
- missingness <-> development
- development <-> sustainability
- sustainability <-> governance
- governance <-> missingness
- ecology <-> missingness
- clustering aggregates all dimensions

Missingness → Development → Ecology → Inequality → Governance
     ↓            ↘             ↓
   Overshoot → Clustering → Composite Index
